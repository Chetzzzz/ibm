# Microfinance Simple Interest Calculator

Welcome to the Microfinance Simple Interest Calculator project!

## Introduction

This project aims to provide a simple yet effective tool for calculating simple interest, which can be used in microfinance initiatives to empower and provide opportunities to low-income individuals. The calculator is developed with the intention of making financial calculations accessible and understandable to everyone, especially those who may not have access to traditional banking services.

## Usage

To use the simple interest calculator, follow these steps:

1. Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the directory containing the script.
3. Run the `simple-interest.sh` script with the appropriate parameters:
    ```bash
    ./simple-interest.sh <principal> <rate> <time>
    ```
   Replace `<principal>`, `<rate>`, and `<time>` with the values for principal amount, interest rate (in percentage), and time (in years) respectively.

4. The script will output the calculated simple interest.
